# ITCS-5154-MelGerst
# Assignments and Final Project for Mel Gerst
#
# Key Files for my Final Project Include
# - FinalReport_DogBreeds_MelGerst.pdf -> Final End of Semester Report
# - dogbreedclassifier_melgerst2.py -> Final Source Code
#
# In addition:
# Multiple PDF files with test results from various epoch levels are included
# as well as several .ipynb Colab files which contain the code base and output result
# from the test runs.
#
# Important Note:
# As noted in my final report, the python code base and Jupyter notebooks rely on 
# accessing the original dog image dataset (20K images) from my Google Drive, since
# Github would not allow the 20k images to be uploaded to this Github account.
#
# Thank You - Mel Gerst
